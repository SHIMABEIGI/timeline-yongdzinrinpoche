            "text": "This interactive and evolving timeline offers a carefully curated introduction to the landmark journey of His Eminence Yongdzin Lopön Tenzin Namdak Rinpoche — a revered master and one of the most influential figures in the Yungdrung Bön tradition. Tracing the arc of his spiritual path illuminates the key milestones of a life dedicated to wisdom, service, and the preservation of one of the world’s oldest spiritual lineages. It highlights his unwavering devotion, visionary leadership, and enduring contributions to the global transmission of Bön philosophy and practice.\n\nWhile accounts of Yongdzin Rinpoche’s life exist in multiple languages — from blog entries to comprehensive biographies — this project marks the first digitally curated timeline of his life and legacy. Created for an increasingly digital world, it is both a tribute and a tool: a place for reflection, learning, and connection with a profound spiritual heritage.\n\nThis timeline is part of a broader, ongoing initiative conceived and built by Shima Beigi, under the guidance of Khenchen Tenpa Yungdrung Rinpoche, the abbot of Triten Norbutse Monastery. The information it contains has been meticulously compiled and reviewed by Khenchen Rinpoche to ensure its authenticity and integrity.\n\nFar from attempting to provide a complete historical record, this living digital document serves as an accessible introduction to the extraordinary legacy of Yongdzin Rinpoche. It is intended to raise awareness of his life’s work and spiritual vision, and to support the wider effort of making his teachings available in digital formats that meet the needs of contemporary and future generations. This timeline, and the digital tools that will follow, are offered as part of that wider aspiration — to help seekers step into the current of his precious life, to encounter the quiet radiance of a master whose presence itself was a profound teaching, and to discover guideposts for embodying the timeless principles of Yungdrung Bön, as personified through the life of Yongdzin Rinpoche."

His birth name was Chime Yungdrung, and his arrival was marked by auspicious signs, including a dream of his mother, Dongza Gachung, in which a white-clad yogi handed her a scripture, saying, This is your Bön destiny. His birthplace, Khyungpo, is tied to the Yungdrung Bön tradition and the ancient Khyung clan. His father, Drewo Pagsam, was from the humble Drewo clan, and his mother hailed from a respected lineage of thangka painters. Rinpoche's childhood was challenging. After his father's illness forced his mother to return home, he was raised by his uncle and aunt. Despite these difficulties, he demonstrated remarkable qualities, including kindness and compassion. Reflecting on his early years, Rinpoche said: There isn't really the time to talk about everything that has happened. Not all of it has been good, and my life has sometimes been quite hard. It was difficult from the very beginning. As a child, I nearly died."

Immersed in this rich cultural and spiritual environment, the young Tenzin Namdak developed a profound affinity for Yungdrung Bön, Tibet’s indigenous spiritual tradition. At the age of seven, he entered Tengchen Monastery, where his uncle served as chant master. There, he became deeply engaged in the rhythm of monastic life, learning basic liturgy and rituals and observing firsthand the disciplined, contemplative existence of the monks."

Through painting, he entered the presence of great Bön masters, including Zöpa Rinpoche, who performed water blessings on Rinpoche as the youngest apprentice and had him paint a series of portraits of the principal Bön deities. His mastery opened many doors: Thangka painting became not only a devotional practice but also a means of livelihood and spiritual connection. Thanks to his talent, Rinpoche travelled to central Tibet at a time when such movement was rare, joining a team of Thangka painters."

They then journeyed through Mustang via Tshokar and followed the Yeru Tsangpo River, approaching the sacred Mount Kailash, known in ancient Tibetan as Tisé, the soul-mountain of the ancient Zhangzhung kings and the site of Tönpa Shenrab Miwo's descent into Tibet. At Dzutrul Cave, Rinpoche and his companions began their circumambulation of Kailash. Amid snowstorms and extreme conditions, Rinpoche suffered frostbite in his right foot, limiting him to six circuits around the mountain. His companions faced their own hardships, with Sherab Tshultrim battling snow-blindness and completing three circuits, while Sherab Sengge managed seven or eight. They visited Jiu Monastery, Lho Trügo, Sera Lung, and Tazam, eventually arriving at Jadur Monastery, the seat of Jadur Nyima Özer, an eminent holder of the Dzogchen lineage. There, they performed the Matri ritual. Rinpoche's companions then returned to their homelands, but he continued alone to Yungdrung Ling Monastery, arriving in the fourth month of the Tibetan calendar. This pilgrimage not only deepened his spiritual resolve but also marked a decisive turning point in his commitment to the path of Yungdrung Bön, laying the foundation for the profound realisation and leadership that would define his life."

There Yongdzin Rinpoche received intensive training in grammar, poetry, cosmology, and the entire framework of Sutra, Tantra, and Dzogchen. During his retreat with Gangru Tsültrim Gyaltsen, Yongdzin Rinpoche was invited to help create a Dutrisu mandala for a nearby monastery, despite restrictions against Khampas. He successfully completed the mandala and supported himself through painting and occasional offerings. Although living in hardship, he remained committed to studying and practising, reflecting that this was just one life's work. That winter, he journeyed to Lhasa, visited sacred sites, received advanced teachings on monastic discipline, cosmology, and Tantra, and practised Thögal in retreat. These experiences deepened his knowledge and led to his rare intellectual and spiritual maturity. In 1948, at the age of 23, he received major initiations, including Namdag, Künrig Drönma, Maseng, Khyungmar, and Tshedrub, and made handwritten copies of precious scriptures.."

During this period, he formed a significant collaboration with Professor David Snellgrove, laying the groundwork for what would become a landmark scholarly work. In 1967, their joint effort culminated in the publication of *The Nine Ways of Bön* by Oxford University Press. This pioneering book presented translations and detailed explanations of essential Bön texts, including selections from the Ziji, the biography of Buddha Tonpa Shenrab. Widely recognised as the first serious academic study of Yungdrung Bön in the West, the publication dispelled the long-held belief that Buddhism was Tibet’s only spiritual tradition. It ignited international interest in Bön studies and contributed to establishing Bön as a legitimate academic field. Throughout this process, Rinpoche played a vital dual role—not only as a cultural informant but also as a dedicated scholar, ensuring the accuracy and authenticity of the translations. This East–West collaboration marked a turning point in raising global awareness of the ancient Bön tradition."

In just two decades, he and a small group of dedicated monks and devotees achieved something truly remarkable: they transformed a fragile community on the brink of extinction into a thriving monastic centre—complete with a functioning abbacy, a growing monastic sangha, a library of sacred texts, and a comprehensive educational system.\n\nThis period required immense faith, tireless effort, and profound organisational skill on Rinpoche’s part. While continuing to teach full-time at the dialectic school of Menri Monastery in Dolanji, he also dedicated himself to research, writing, and the transmission of initiations and instructions to a new generation of Bön lamas.\n\nThe culmination of this intense phase of engagement and contemplation resulted in the compilation of over 22 authoritative volumes, covering a vast range of topics central to the Bön tradition, including:\n\n- The successive lives of Tonpa Shenrab, the revered founder of Bön, and an exploration of his teachings and their enduring impact on the tradition.\n- The history and doctrinal foundations of Yungdrung Bön, detailing the tradition’s development and spiritual significance within the broader landscape of Tibetan religious culture.\n- Cosmology, iconography, and the sacred arts, offering insight into the deep interconnection between belief, ritual, and artistic expression in Bön culture.\n- Detailed expositions of the Nine Vehicles of Bön, presenting the diverse paths of practice available to followers, each corresponding to varying levels of understanding and spiritual capacity.\n- Instructions on meditation and ritual practices, guiding practitioners through both personal and communal spiritual journeys toward realisation and enlightenment.\n\nThrough these monumental works, Yongdzin Rinpoche ensured that the profound and subtle knowledge of the Bön tradition would not only survive but flourish, preserved in an authoritative form for future generations to study, practice, and draw inspiration from."

                "text": "In 2010, His Eminence Yongdzin Lopön Tenzin Namdak Rinpoche arranged for the return of two sacred images to the original Menri Monastery in Tibet—relics he had personally safeguarded since his escape from Tibet in 1960. Before fleeing, Rinpoche had foreseen the impending destruction and taken extraordinary steps to protect Bön's most treasured spiritual treasures. At a remote cave in Lug-do Drag in the Tsochen area, he concealed the revered relic stupa of Nyame Sherab Gyaltsen—one of Bön's greatest saints—along with statues and numerous sacred objects to shield them from looting and desecration. He also carried with him, at great personal risk, several volumes of irreplaceable Bön scriptures, including the complete Oral Transmission of the Zhang Zhung Nyengyüd and other essential texts. Thanks to this remarkable foresight and devotion, Rinpoche preserved the flame of Yungdrung Bön through one of the darkest periods in its history. Decades later, those very relics and texts became instrumental in reviving the tradition in exile. Their return to Menri in 2010 was not merely a symbolic moment—it was the culmination of Rinpoche's lifelong vow to protect and restore the sacred heritage of Bön in its native land."

These years marked the first time in history that such profound teachings, traditionally reserved for advanced monastics, were fully transmitted to a dedicated community of lay practitioners in the West. Rinpoche personally gave empowerments (wang), oral transmissions (lung), and detailed instructions (tri), ensuring the authentic and unbroken continuation of the Dzogchen lineage outside Tibet. This transmission laid the foundation for a new generation of committed Dzogchen practitioners, reflecting Rinpoche's deep trust in the sincerity and capacity of his Western disciples."

Drawing from his deep spiritual authority and decades-long leadership within the Bön tradition, Rinpoche provided clear instructions to ensure that the election process upheld the lineage's integrity, ritual protocols, and traditional procedures. His guidance ensured a smooth transition of spiritual leadership, ultimately resulting in the unanimous selection of Geshe Dawa Dhargye, the 34th Menri Trizin, as the new abbot. This moment marked the continuity of the Menri throne and reaffirmed Rinpoche's unwavering commitment to preserving Bön's institutional and spiritual legacy."
