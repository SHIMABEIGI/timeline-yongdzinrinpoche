Immersed in this rich cultural and spiritual environment, the young Tenzin Namdak developed a profound affinity for Yungdrung Bön, Tibet’s indigenous spiritual tradition. At the age of seven, he entered Tengchen Monastery, where his uncle served as chant master. There, he became deeply engaged in the rhythm of monastic life, learning basic liturgy and rituals and observing firsthand the disciplined, contemplative existence of the monks."

Tragically, this endeavour was fraught with danger, as he was shot and subsequently captured, leading to a period of imprisonment that lasted approximately ten months."

By the early 1960s, Bönpo lamas and monks were scattered and living in dire conditions, with no organised support. Rinpoche and a small group of Bönpo refugees recognised that without immediate action, their ancient tradition could easily disappear. From 1964 onwards, he worked tirelessly to establish a permanent base for Bön in exile. In 1966, under his leadership, the Tibetan Bönpo Foundation was formally registered with the Indian government in the indian state of Uttar Pradesh."

Over the following three years, from 1961 to 1964, he immersed himself in studying English—an entirely new language to him at the time—reaching a level that enabled him to teach Tibetan to Western students and share the foundational principles of the Bön tradition. During this period, he formed a significant collaboration with Professor David Snellgrove, laying the groundwork for what would become a landmark scholarly work. In 1967, their joint effort culminated in the publication of *The Nine Ways of Bön* by Oxford University Press. This pioneering book presented translations and detailed explanations of essential Bön texts, including selections from the Ziji, the biography of Buddha Tonpa Shenrab. Widely recognised as the first serious academic study of Yungdrung Bön in the West, the publication dispelled the long-held belief that Buddhism was Tibet’s only spiritual tradition. It ignited international interest in Bön studies and contributed to establishing Bön as a legitimate academic field. Throughout this process, Rinpoche played a vital dual role—not only as a cultural informant but also as a dedicated scholar, ensuring the accuracy and authenticity of the translations. This East–West collaboration marked a turning point in raising global awareness of the ancient Bön tradition."

Operating under dire conditions—with only a few surviving monks and scarce resources—Rinpoche led the revival of Menri Monastery in exile at the Dolanji site, revitalising monastic education and ritual practice at the heart of the Bön tradition. Thanks to Rinpoche's relentless organisational leadership and vision, Menri Monastery at Dolanji became not only the spiritual and educational centre of the exile Bön tradition but also one of only two centres in the world—alongside Triten Norbutse in Nepal—offering full Geshe training in Yungdrung Bön."

The divination and prayers performed in India officially initiated the lineage in exile and marked the formal inauguration of Menri Monastery in Exile. While still in London, Rinpoche played a vital role in organising the traditional election of a new abbot for the exile monastery following the death of the previous one, thereby re-establishing the spiritual leadership of the Bön tradition in exile. Geshe Sangye Tenzin, although abroad at the time, was welcomed back to India from Oslo in November 1969 and was given the name Lungtok Tenpai Nyima. His enthronement officially renewed the spiritual leadership of the exile Bön community."

He coordinated efforts to recover Bön manuscripts from remote areas of Nepal and Tibet, where Bön had been practised for centuries. These manuscripts – some of which were the very texts he had hidden or carried away – were brought to India, carefully reprinted in Delhi, and distributed to the newly re-established Bön study centres as well as Western universities."

In just two decades, he and a small group of dedicated monks and devotees achieved something truly remarkable: they transformed a fragile community on the brink of extinction into a thriving monastic centre—complete with a functioning abbacy, a growing monastic sangha, a library of sacred texts, and a comprehensive educational system.\n\nThis period required immense faith, tireless effort, and profound organisational skill on Rinpoche’s part. While continuing to teach full-time at the dialectic school of Menri Monastery in Dolanji, he also dedicated himself to research, writing, and the transmission of initiations and instructions to a new generation of Bön lamas.\n\nThe culmination of this intense phase of engagement and contemplation resulted in the compilation of over 22 authoritative volumes, covering a vast range of topics central to the Bön tradition, including:\n\n- The successive lives of Tonpa Shenrab, the revered founder of Bön, and an exploration of his teachings and their enduring impact on the tradition.\n- The history and doctrinal foundations of Yungdrung Bön, detailing the tradition’s development and spiritual significance within the broader landscape of Tibetan religious culture.\n- Cosmology, iconography, and the sacred arts, offering insight into the deep interconnection between belief, ritual, and artistic expression in Bön culture.\n- Detailed expositions of the Nine Vehicles of Bön, presenting the diverse paths of practice available to followers, each corresponding to varying levels of understanding and spiritual capacity.\n- Instructions on meditation and ritual practices, guiding practitioners through both personal and communal spiritual journeys toward realisation and enlightenment.\n\nThrough these monumental works, Yongdzin Rinpoche ensured that the profound and subtle knowledge of the Bön tradition would not only survive but flourish, preserved in an authoritative form for future generations to study, practice, and draw inspiration from."
